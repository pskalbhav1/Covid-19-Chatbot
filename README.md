# Covid-19-Chatbot

During this pandemic, the healthcare industry has developed rapidly in order to combat covid in the best way possible. All of us have a lot of concerns regarding our health and steps to take for precautions. Doctors and healthcare workers have been working on the frontline, due to which, they don't have time to answer queries that we have regarding our safety and health. In order to tackle the problem, I have designed a chatbot using machine learning, specifically trained on Covid-19 data that can answer questions regarding Covid-19 accurately. It concerns the health and lifestyle of people in the 'new normal' post Covid-19.
